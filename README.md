# auto_recorder
A Noise-Activated Recording App

## Description
Auto-Recorder is an innovative Flutter application that utilizes the deviceâ€™s microphone to actively monitor ambient sound levels. When the app detects noise above a predefined threshold, it automatically initiates audio recording, capturing the surrounding sounds.

## Features
Automatic Noise Detection: The app continuously listens for environmental sounds and starts recording when the noise level exceeds the user-set sensitivity.
Adjustable Sensitivity: Users can adjust the noise threshold to ensure the recorder activates only when desired, preventing unnecessary recordings during minimal noise disturbances.

## Reference
The app can be installed from the Amazon Appstore.
